1) Do we really need View interface? Only one call to each method (Enter Update Exit) and only two View types (*GameView and *MenuView).

2) inlined drawThumbnail() and drawSelection() (which should have been named drawSelectionHighlightBorder())

commit

* inline director's Run method (what the fuck is the difference between Run() and Start()?)

* inline ShowMenu() and SetTitle() of Director

* in main.go, put getPaths inside main(). (Would have inlined its code, but this way we dont have to modify its logic.)

* in font.go, inline WordWrap(), DrawText(), and DrawCharacter(). (DrawText should have been called DrawTextSingleLine() or somesuch)
* inline CreateGenericThumbnail


* Something odd with Director containing both view and menuView? Why does GameView and MenuView need a Director?
