* inline View.Enter, .Update, .Exit and remove from them View interface 
(Do we really need View interface? Only one call to each method (Enter Update Exit) and only two View types (*GameView and *MenuView).)
* inlined drawThumbnail() and drawSelection() (which should have been named drawSelectionHighlightBorder())
* inline director's Run method (what the fuck is the difference between Run() and Start()?)
* inline ShowMenu() and SetTitle() of Director
* in main.go, put getPaths inside main(). (Would have inlined its code, but this way we dont have to modify its logic.)
* in font.go, inline WordWrap(), DrawText(), and DrawCharacter(). (DrawText should have been called DrawTextSingleLine() or somesuch)
* inline CreateGenericThumbnail
* inlined *Texture.downloadThumbnail()
* inline Texture.Bind, Texture.Unbind, Texture.Purge, Texture.Lookup. Texture.lru, Texture.loadThumbnail
* inline Texture.coord (should have been coords() plural)
* inline NewDirector
* inline Director.Step
* inline font.go init() into Run()
* moved rest of font.go into director.go and deleted font.go
* inline NewGameView(), updateControllers(), drawBuffer()
* inline NewMenuView()   (function was misleading because name implies general case, but there is only one specific case! so how general was it really?)
* moved GameView and *GameView.onKey to director.go
* inline as anon func *GameView.onKey and *MenuView.onChar
* deleted now empty gameview.go
* inlined MenuView.clampSelection(), .highlight(), .checkButtons()
* inlined NewTexture()
* removed empty font.go
* changed *Texture.load() to loadTexture()  (loadTexture is long and ugly enough that I didn't inline it even though it's only called in once place)
* made DrawCenteredText a private function inside loadTexture
* changed *Director.playGame() to playGame() and *Director.setView() to setView()
* made onPress a private func right before its two calls
* inlined NewAudio and methods of *Audio

commit

* moved playGame(), clampScroll(), and loadTexture() into Run()
    (perhaps a subfunc top-level keyword in which you specify the name of the one functions in which this function is used)
    (maybe allow us to specify multiply functions, but that kind of defeats the purpose: as soon as a function is called in two other top-level functions, it's not mentally confineable the same way)
    unfortunate that in requires us to put the subfunction declarations ahead of their use in other subfunctions (requiring predeclaration in cases of mutual recursion (and self-recursion?))
    (perhaps just have subfuncs go at end of the function body rather than top, or maybe allow them to be anywhere but constrained to scope, but can be used in scope before their declaration)

* removed .director from both GameView and MenuView


* Something odd with Director containing both view and menuView? can we remove menuView?
* confusingly, Texture has many methods and struct members that concern only the MenuView, not the GameView



package nes

* move all types to nes_types.go
* inline NewCartridge, NewController, 




* use blocks allow for more early-return style logic which tends to be flatter (less nesting)
