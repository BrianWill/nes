* inline View.Enter, .Update, .Exit and remove from them View interface 
(Do we really need View interface? Only one call to each method (Enter Update Exit) and only two View types (*GameView and *MenuView).)
* inlined drawThumbnail() and drawSelection() (which should have been named drawSelectionHighlightBorder())

commit

* inline director's Run method (what the fuck is the difference between Run() and Start()?)
* inline ShowMenu() and SetTitle() of Director
* in main.go, put getPaths inside main(). (Would have inlined its code, but this way we dont have to modify its logic.)
* in font.go, inline WordWrap(), DrawText(), and DrawCharacter(). (DrawText should have been called DrawTextSingleLine() or somesuch)
* inline CreateGenericThumbnail

commit

* inline Texture.Bind, Texture.Unbind, Texture.Purge, Texture.Lookup. Texture.lru, Texture.loadThumbnail
* inline Texture.coord (should have been coords() plural)
* inline NewDirector
* inline Director.Step

commit

* inline font.go init() into Run()
* inline NewGameView(), updateControllers()
* inline NewMenuView()   (function was misleading because name implies general case, but there is only one specific case! so how general was it really?)
* moved GameView and *GameView.onKey to run.go
* deleted now empty gameview.go
* inlined MenuView.clampSelection(), .highlight(), .checkButtons()

commit

* inlined *Texture.downloadThumbnail()
* changed *Texture.load() to loadTexture()
* 




* Something odd with Director containing both view and menuView? Why does GameView and MenuView need a Director?

* confusingly, Texture has many methods and struct members that concern only the MenuView, not the GameView
