* inline View.Enter, .Update, .Exit and remove from them View interface 
(Do we really need View interface? Only one call to each method (Enter Update Exit) and only two View types (*GameView and *MenuView).)
* inlined drawThumbnail() and drawSelection() (which should have been named drawSelectionHighlightBorder())

commit

* inline director's Run method (what the fuck is the difference between Run() and Start()?)
* inline ShowMenu() and SetTitle() of Director
* in main.go, put getPaths inside main(). (Would have inlined its code, but this way we dont have to modify its logic.)
* in font.go, inline WordWrap(), DrawText(), and DrawCharacter(). (DrawText should have been called DrawTextSingleLine() or somesuch)
* inline CreateGenericThumbnail
* inlined *Texture.downloadThumbnail()

commit

* inline Texture.Bind, Texture.Unbind, Texture.Purge, Texture.Lookup. Texture.lru, Texture.loadThumbnail
* inline Texture.coord (should have been coords() plural)
* inline NewDirector
* inline Director.Step

commit

* inline font.go init() into Run()
* moved rest of font.go into director.go and deleted font.go
* inline NewGameView(), updateControllers(), drawBuffer()
* inline NewMenuView()   (function was misleading because name implies general case, but there is only one specific case! so how general was it really?)
* moved GameView and *GameView.onKey to director.go
* inline as anon func *GameView.onKey and *MenuView.onChar
* deleted now empty gameview.go
* inlined MenuView.clampSelection(), .highlight(), .checkButtons()
* inlined NewTexture()
* removed empty font.go

commit

* changed *Texture.load() to loadTexture()  (loadTexture is long and ugly enough that I didn't inline it even though it's only called in once place)
* made DrawCenteredText a private function inside loadTexture
* changed *Director.playGame() to playGame() and *Director.setView() to setView()
* made onPress a private func right before its two calls
* inlined NewAudio
* 






* Something odd with Director containing both view and menuView? Why does GameView and MenuView need a Director?

* confusingly, Texture has many methods and struct members that concern only the MenuView, not the GameView
