1) Do we really need View interface? Only one call to each method (Enter Update Exit) and only two View types (*GameView and *MenuView).

2) inlined drawThumbnail() and drawSelection() (which should have been named drawSelectionHighlightBorder())

commit

* inline director's Run method (what the fuck is the difference between Run() and Start()?)

* inline ShowMenu() and SetTitle() of Director

* in main.go, put getPaths inside main(). (Would have inlined its code, but this way we dont have to modify its logic.)

* in font.go, inline WordWrap(), DrawText(), and DrawCharacter(). (DrawText should have been called DrawTextSingleLine() or somesuch)
* inline CreateGenericThumbnail

commit

* inline Texture.Bind, Texture.Unbind, Texture.Purge, Texture.Lookup. Texture.lru, Texture.loadThumbnail
* inline Texture.coord (should have been coords() plural)
* inline NewDirector
* inline Director.Step




* Something odd with Director containing both view and menuView? Why does GameView and MenuView need a Director?

* confusingly, Texture has many methods and struct members that concern only the MenuView, not the GameView
